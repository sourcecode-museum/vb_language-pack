VB Language Pack Generator Version 1.20
Developed by Frederico Machado (indiofu@bol.com.br)

UPDATED: Version 1.20
Now my Language Pack Generator can handle Indexed Controls
and Indexed Menus. It is also able to translate SSTabs.
Especial thanks to Emiliano F. Martin (Mc Brain) who helped
me to make this fixes, and to Christian Høj (Chris101) who
insisted in make this tool the best Language Pack ever.
Thank you guys!


CHANGES: Version 1.10
I've choosen to use TreeView instead Listbox to show
forms and objects/controls.
I think it's too much organized then listboxes, the
application looks more "professional".

You can use this code in your own applications
but don't forget to give me some credit, ok?

Vote for me if you like it!

Thanks
