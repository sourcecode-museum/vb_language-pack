VB Language Pack Generator Version 1.30
Developed by Frederico Machado (fredisoft@terra.com.br)


UPDATED: Version 1.30 (06/07/2005)

The format of the pack file was changed and the app is
doing a very simple encryption in the pack file to make
texts unreadable.
Now the app can save "Strings" to translate not just
captions and tooltips of your project, but everything.
It was added a Grid for easy editing of captions and tooltips.
Now you can Re-Open your language packs and edit them.
You can Re-Open a language pack to edit, then Re-Load the
VB Project, so the application will set new captions and
get new controls to the pack.
It's very easy to use!



CHANGES: Version 1.20

Now my Language Pack Generator can handle Indexed Controls
and Indexed Menus. It is also able to translate SSTabs.
Especial thanks to Emiliano F. Martin (Mc Brain) who helped
me to make this fixes, and to Christian Høj (Chris101) who
insisted in make this tool the best Language Pack ever.
Thank you guys!


CHANGES: Version 1.10

I've choosen to use TreeView instead Listbox to show
forms and objects/controls.
I think it's too much organized then listboxes, the
application looks more "professional".


You can use this code in your own applications
but don't forget to give me some credit, ok?

Vote for me if you like it!

Thanks
